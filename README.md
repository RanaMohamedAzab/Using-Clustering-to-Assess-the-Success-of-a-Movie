# Using-Clustering-to-Assess-the-Success-of-a-Movie
The objective is to know what we can conclude about the success of a movie based on its features using unsupervised learning techniques. 

# The dataset retrieved from: 
T. M. D. (TMDb), “TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset,” Kaggle, 28-Sep-2017. [Online]. Available: https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata. [Accessed: 14-Feb-2021]. 

# Objective:
In this project, I am only concerned to study the measures of movies success to be better able to predict and assess whether a movie will be successful or not by looking out for the common features between successful movies using one of the unsupervised learnig techniques (K-clustering)

# Data Description:
The dataset contains information about 4803 movie with 53 variables describing each movie. The dataset is very rich and can be used in many ways (e.g. building recommendation system for movies or evaluating the succeess of a movie based upon its features). The only variavles I am concerned with based upon my objective are:
The movie's budget, popularity, revenue, vote average and vote count. I am only concerned with these value since they reflect how successful was the movies with regard to the generated profits, popularity and rating.

# Data Preparation, Analysis Techniques and Results
The methods used in data preparation and analysis techniques together with the output resuls and insights are explained with more details in the attached report.
